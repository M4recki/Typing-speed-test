# Typing speed test

The Typing Speed Test is a Python project that measures the time, accuracy, and speed of a user's typing. It allows the user to type out a passage of text within a set time duration and calculates the number of words and characters the user can type per minute (WPM and CPM) and the accuracy of the typed text.
